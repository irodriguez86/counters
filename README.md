# App Counter

An application to have independent counters with buttons to add or subtract from its own counter, and also have a total count that count all the counter components in the bottom.

## Setup
Run `npm install`, then run `npm start` to start the application and `npm test` to run the tests.

## Stage1:
The `+` and `-` currently don't do anything. We'd like to see that everytime
the `+` button is clicked, the associated number displayed should be incremented by `1` and when the `-` button is clicked, the associated number displayed should be decremented by `1`.

## Stage2:
There is new requirement for an extra Counter and ensure its value is updated independently from the others.

## Stage3:
Users expressed that would be useful to see the total number that represents the sum of all the counters. Add a new element to the application to show this result.

## Stage4:
The application has no style whatsoever. We include an screenshot. Try to add some CSS so it looks as similar as possible.
